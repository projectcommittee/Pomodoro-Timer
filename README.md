# Pomodoro-Timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

This Pomodoro-Timer is based on a simple Javascript code by setting various variables and applying simple logic to make timers. At last the JS code is executed with help of HTML & CSS front-end web deployment.

## Development of this project
Although the project was initially made for personal use, but after giving it a thought it seemed a great addition to our resume as well.
With this project the increasing the efficiency of the work was the main motive wherein the break could be used to review your work or reviewing the objective of the work you just did or simply as a break.


## Future Plans
We would like to add custom timer value capability for both 'work' as well as 'break' which would give it more flexibilty for anyone's usage.
